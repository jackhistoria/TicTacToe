# TicTacToe
Its a simple tic tac toe game with 2 players or one against a radom coputed player

It is working with c++ 17 and should be work with c++11. Created for Linux, but should work on windows and mac os properly.

Do what you want with it, make it better, add stuff, make the computer intelligent not only random and the code more beauty.

I splitted it on a project file just to try it out. 

Enjoy it.
